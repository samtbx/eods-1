# EODS Recruitment Test

## Intro

This repository contains the data, documentation and solution to the EODS role
recruitment test, which aims to expose a candidate's ability to develop a
programmatic solution to handle, process and error assess 50 DEMs. The candidate
is also asked to create an elevation profile between two points.


## Preamble

*You are helping to supply data for a project located in Kurdistan, Iraq.
The client is looking to build a vital water pipeline for the nearby villages.
Currently you have 50 noisy Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) that have been collected
from multiple satellite platforms with different resolutions. These need to be
evaluated against a reference DEM that we have been supplied by the client. Be
aware of different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) here.*
